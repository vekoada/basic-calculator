# Calculator

## Description

This is a basic calculator webapp. The goal was to get better at foundational vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS concepts while building something (moderately) useful. I wanted to build a calculator that both *worked* and *felt good* to use. 

Going forward, I'm thinking of ironing out some of the edge cases, adding more advanced calculator features and keyboard support, and allowing the user to drag/drop/resize and customize the calculator colors. 

This will strengthen my grasp of the features of vanilla JavaScript and serve as a gateway into more advanced applications.

## Features

- Basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear functionality
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Structure

```
calculator/
│
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── README.md
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the calculator.

## Future

I want to add additional features:
- Let the user resize the calculator when on desktop
- Let the user drag and drop the calculator to another position on the page
- Adding more advanced calculation functionality

## Learning Objectives
- Get better at JavaScript, CSS
- Reinforce HTML concepts
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
